# GIT Exercise

The goal of this repository is to create an exercise for students on learning GIT. They will add features and unit tests
for different products but also will have to create some changes in the main function for which it is important to avoid
or resolve merge conflicts. The code is based on the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata. It is used in the class of 2021 as
well.

# Used by Jelle Van Goethem (Nycto97) for school

I use this repo to practice my GitHub skills. I want to learn how commits, pushes, forks,... work, since I'm fairly new
to GitHub. I came across GitHub already and used it a few times to download software, but never used it to manage code.
I'm pretty excited to learn everything GitHub related.

# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on
GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See
also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

As Bobby Johnson points out in his
article ["Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"](http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/12/07/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture)
, it'll actually give you better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#.
However, I think this kata is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and
approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored
code and tests look like in different programming languages.
